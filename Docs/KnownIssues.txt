The following is a list of known issues with StepMania 5.

* Hidden, Sudden, Stealth, and RandomVanish do not work with layered
  note skins. Random Vanish, in particular, has caused crashes.
* The course editor is not working completely.
* The scoring system needs to be made global for the game instead
  of tying it to the theme. Right now, this is causing a number
  of themes to have no score display during gameplay.
* The C and V keys in the editor (related to attacks) still has
  work to go. Crashes should hopefully be minimal if not otherwise
  nonexistant.
* Attacks involving noteskins do not work. They may never work
  again unless some internal coding issues are figured out.
* Routine mode (dance or pump) isn't perfect yet.
** In particular, routine mode and practice steps may crash.
* If two players play Oni mode, having one player fail causes a crash.
* The attempted new unlock code written a Preview or two ago
  does not seem to work at this time. Assistance may be needed here.
* Hold/Roll heads seem to be draw under preceding taps when they
  shouldn't be all the time.
* C-Mods have not been fully tested with all of the new segments yet.
