.ssc Format Changelog
________________________________________________________________________________
In case anyone else wishes to implement the .ssc format in their own simulator,
a changelog is provided here between each version.

Notice: .ssc is not a finalized format at the moment. There are plans for a
change to JSON, but it is unsure if this will be done.

Implement .ssc at your own risk.
