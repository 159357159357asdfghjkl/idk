The Golden Rules of sm-ssc Development
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to CodingStyle.txt, this is the doctrine for operation of sm-ssc.

1) Always remember that the original branch of StepMania exists, and that we need
to give back to it in order for sm-ssc to survive.
(Literal: Be sure to commit useful changes/fixes to the mainline StepMania branch
every so often.)

2) If you want something done, you should probably work on it yourself. However,
SSC members should be willing to help if their area of expertise and the problem
domain overlap (life permitting).

3) Always know your priorities. sm-ssc is important, but it's not life itself.
Take breaks every once in a while. Work on other things. Don't get burned out
from nonstop sm-ssc development.

4) Patches should be checked for compatibility/compilability before being
accepted and integrated. Common sense, but a golden rule nevertheless.

5) Anyone who decides to theme for sm-ssc during development is willing to
accept that occasionally, changes to the default and/or fallback theme will
break things.
