CMake Installation
==
There are two ways of working with cmake: the command line and the GUI.

CMake Command Line
===

If you are unfamiliar with cmake, first run `cmake --help`. This will present a list of options and generators. The generators are used for setting up your project.

The following steps will assume you operate from the StepMania project's Build directory.

For the first setup, you will want to run this command:

`cmake -G {YourGeneratorHere} .. && cmake ..`

Replace {YourGeneratorHere} with one of the generator choices from `cmake --help`.

If any cmake project file changes, you can just run `cmake .. && cmake ..` to get up to date. If this by itself doesn't work, you may have to clean the cmake cache. Use `rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeScripts/ CMakeFiles/ cmake_install.txt` to do that, and then run the generator command again.

The reason for running cmake at least twice is to make sure that all of the variables get set up appropriately.

Environment variables can be modified at this stage. If you want to pass `-ggdb` or any other flag that is not set up by default, utilize `CXXFLAGS` or any appropriate variable.

CMake GUI
===

For those that use the GUI to work with cmake, you need to specify where the source code is and where the binaries will be built. The first one, counter-intuitively, is actually the parent directory of this one: the main StepMania directory. The second one for building can be this directory.

Upon setting the source and build directories, you should `Configure` the build. If no errors show up, you can hit `Generate` until none of the rows on the GUI are red.

If the cmake project file changes, you can just generate the build to get up to date. If this by itself doesn't work, you may have to clean the cmake cache. Go to File -> Delete Cache, and then run the `Configure` and `Generate` steps again.

With that, you should be good to go.
