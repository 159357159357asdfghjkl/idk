The stepmania5.spec file will allow you to create RPM pachages for distros
using them like Fedora or OpenSUSE. To build and package Stepmania run:

    rpmbuild -bb stepmania5.spec

Will generate an RPM package provided all needed development packages are
available, if not, a message will tell you which packages are missing.
