EnvUtils2: Environmental Variable Utilities
Written by AJ Kelly of KKI Labs / Version 2.0

This code is a rewrite of what typically exists in EnvUtils.lua
(as seen in dubaiOne), hereafter referred to as EnvUtils1.

I felt it was time for a simplification of the code.
This new version should also work better and be less confusing.

-- Env table global
envTable = GAMESTATE:Env()

-- setenv(name,value)
-- Sets aside an entry for /name/ and puts /value/ into it.
-- Unlike EnvUtils1, this is the only setenv function available to you.
-- If you need to store more than one value, you're welcome to use a
-- table as /value/, it should work just fine.
function setenv(name,value)
	envTable[name] = value
end

-- getenv(name)
-- This will return whatever value is at envTable[name].
function getenv(name)
	return envTable[name]
end
